In order to be self-contained in terms of required 
proteomics background knowledge, we begin with a short 
introduction to the broad concepts of proteomics 
(\refsec{proteomics}) and \gls{ms}
(\refsec{ms}).
In \refsec{FFPEandIHC} we introduce some more specific 
proteomics topics that will be relevant to our context.
We then discuss the technique that is the main focus of 
this project, \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, in 
\refsec{maldiims}.
Finally, in \refsec{data} we introduce data sourced 
from three different applications of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} --- the study of: peptides from 
ovarian cancer tumours embedded in surrounding healthy 
tissues, glycans from murine kidney tissue, and 
peptides from endometrial and vulvar cancer tumour 
tissues arranged in \glspl{tma}.
Each of these applications highlights different aspects 
of the potential in \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data.
The remainder of this thesis is concerned with 
developing data analysis methods for such applications.
For example, clustering of the ovarian cancer data
highlights the ability of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} to 
separate tissue types spatially.
Classification of the endometrial data highlights the 
ability of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} to contribute to 
diagnostics by use of \glspl{tma}.

The discussion of proteomics in this chapter is biased
towards points relevant to \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, as 
this is our main interest. 
For more complete reviews of proteomics as a whole and 
the role of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, see 
\citet{Mallick2010}, \citet{Schwamborn2010} and 
references therein. 
\citet{Wu2003} also provide an overview of some of
the statistical challenges inherent in working with
proteomics \gls{ms} data. 

\section{Proteomics}
\label{sec:proteomics}

Proteins are biological molecules involved in most 
cellular processes and consisting of a sequence of 
amino acids that are chemically connected by 
`peptide bonds'.
When connected in this fashion, each amino acid in a 
protein is referred to as a residue.
There exist $22$ naturally occurring proteinogenic amino 
acids in eukaryotes --- organisms whose cells 
contain nuclei.
Naively, it could be said that this means there are 
$22^n$ possible unique linear proteins of $n$ residues 
--- in reality it is a smaller number than this, but a 
very large number nonetheless.
Each gene can simplistically be thought of as code for 
a protein's amino acid sequence. 
Living organisms transcribe a gene and synthesise the 
corresponding protein as a linear amino acid sequence 
which then undergoes post-translational modification 
and folds into a complex three dimensional structure w
hich usually determines the protein's function and 
intra-cellular location.
The compounding diversity of: linear amino acid 
sequence post-translational modification, and three 
dimensional folding is what allows proteins to fill 
such a wide variety of functions.
The complete set of proteins which exist in a given 
cell, tissue or biological fluid, under defined 
conditions, is termed its proteome \citep{Wilkins1996}. 
Proteomics is the study of proteomes, and often of how 
proteomes change.
Proteomes vary considerably between different cellular 
states and understanding these variations can provide 
remarkable insights.
A cell in the lining of your stomache would have a 
virtually identical genome to a neuron in your brain, 
but they would contain dramatically different 
proteomes, and the differences between their proteomes 
is what allows for such dramatic differences in their 
phenotypes --- behaviour and functions. 
We are particularly interested in the effects diseases 
have on the proteomes of cells.
Studying these effects can elucidate mechanisms 
involved in disease behaviour and provide insight 
into the development and progression of diseases. 
Such fundamental knowledge could lead to new approaches 
for both diagnosis and treatment \citep{Casadonte2011}. 

The study of proteomics includes the 
identification, quantification, and/or localisation of 
proteins in a sample \citep{Ong2005}.
Samples are often sourced from a cell culture, but 
other biological sources are possible --- such as: 
saliva \citep{Vitorino2004}, 
blood \citep{Liotta2003,Thadikkaran2005}, tissue 
\citep{Chaurand2004}, and even animal specimens
\citep{Khatib-Shahidi2006}.
Proteomics is an extremely broad field, but techniques
that can characterise the proteins present in a sample
are needed across almost all areas of the field.
\gls{ms} is the core method in proteomics for 
characterising and identifying the proteins in a sample 
\citep{Yates2009}.
Many different technologies have been developed in 
proteomics \gls{ms} \citep{Aebersold2003}.
In the following section we explain the principles 
behind \gls{ms} and its role in various applications 
within proteomics, and in particular how it is extended
for use in \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.


\section{Mass Spectrometry}
\label{sec:ms}

A mass spectrometer measures the \gls{mz} ratio of 
molecules ionised from a given sample.
To achieve this, a mass spectrometer invariably 
consists of three crucial components: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An ion source,
  \item A mass analyser, and
  \item A detector.
\end{enumerate}
As its name implies, the ion source converts sample 
molecules into gaseous ions, which allows them to be 
manipulated using electromagnetic fields.
The mass analyser separates the ions according to their 
\gls{mz} by controlled application of electromagnetic 
fields.
The detector counts ions after they have been 
separated in the mass analyser, thereby producing a
mass spectrum of ion counts versus \gls{mz}.
This section briefly discusses the ion source 
and mass analyser that we use in imaging 
experiments, \gls{maldi} and \gls{tof}
respectively.
For \gls{ims} on biological samples, \gls{maldi}
is used almost exclusively.
\gls{maldi} can also be used in \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} 
analyses of proteins and peptides, but 
Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) is the 
predominant ion source for \gls{lc}-\gls{ms}.
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms} is very useful in proteomics due to 
its ability to reproducibly identify the peptide 
sequences of analytes in complex mixtures.
As \gls{lc} is a core technique in proteomics, a brief 
introduction to \gls{lc}, specifically \gls{lc}-ESI, is
included in \refsec{fractionation}.

Although we peripherally refer to some 
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms} identification results in 
\refsec{Nglycans} and \refsec{opt_opt}, the focus of 
this work is on \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, and so the 
discussion of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} in 
\refsec{maldiims} is appropriately more detailed than 
the discussion of \gls{lc}-ESI-\gls{ms} in 
\refsec{fractionation}. 
Note that when we discuss \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} what we are
ultimately referring to is \gls{msms}, which is the 
fragmentation of analytes to determine their identity.
Although the distinction betwen \gls{ms} and \gls{msms} 
is important, it is of only tangential relevance to our 
work and so for brevity we avoid a detailed discussion
and simply refer to \gls{lc}-\gls{ms}.

Of course there are other ion source options, 
often designed to ionise particular types of target 
molecule. 
For example, Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma 
(LA-ICP) is a popular ionisation method for measuring 
trace element concentrations such as copper, gold, 
silver, arsenic, etc. 
% \citep{Winderbaum2012}.
LA-ICP-\gls{ms} can even be used for imaging, and 
has been used in conjunction with \gls{ge} and 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ms} to study phospho- and 
metal-containing proteins 
\citep{Becker2009,Becker2010}. 
LA-ICP-\gls{ms} is one of the most extreme 
examples of what are called `hard' ionisation methods.
Hard ionisation methods often fragment large molecules 
during the ionisation process, destroying information about the original 
intact analytes --- LA-ICP-\gls{ms} typically 
fragments analytes down to their elemental composition.
The `soft' ionisation methods such as \gls{maldi} and 
ESI are by far the most popular for mass 
spectrometric analysis in proteomics as they allow for
large biological molecules to be converted into gaseous 
ions with minimal fragmentation. 

\subsection{MALDI}
\label{sec:maldi}

There are many types of ion source, and most are 
optimised for particular substances or molecules.
\gls{maldi} is an ionisation method which avoids 
significant fragmentation of large organic analytes
due to the relatively low energy levels that it 
operates at.
\gls{maldi} functions by adding a matrix to the sample, 
which is a small molecule and acts as the primary 
absorber for a laser system which provides the 
ionisation energy.
There are numerous matrices available, each with 
advantages and disadvantages, but in each case the 
matrix is a small molecule whose role is to absorb at 
the wavelength of the laser system and transfer the 
absorbed energy to the sample in a controlled manner, 
ionising the analytes in such a way that their covalent 
bonds are not broken.
\gls{maldi} has the added advantage of almost always 
producing singly charged ions ($z = 1$) for peptides. 
The interpretation of \gls{maldi} spectra is 
significantly simplified as $z=1$ can be assumed for 
low-mass peptides, meaning the measured \gls{mz} can be 
interpreted as simply molecular mass ($m$) plus a 
proton that provides the single positive charge.
This reduction in complexity is important in the 
analysis of complex biological samples, as we will 
discuss in more depth in \refsec{fractionation}.

\subsection{Time-of-Flight (TOF)}
\label{sec:tof}

\newcommand{\KE}{E_{k}}

Allowing analyte ions to travel through a field-free
drift region separates analyte ions by \gls{mz}, and 
this type of mass analyser is coined \acrfull{tof} as 
analytes are separated based on the time they spend in 
the field-free drift region --- see 
\reffig{msSchematic}.
Other types of mass analyser are also used, but we will 
focus on \gls{tof}-\gls{ms} as this is the most common 
approach for \gls{ims}, and all the data we will 
consider in detail were collected using this mass 
analyser type.
In \gls{tof}-\gls{ms}, the sample is ionised (given a 
charge $z$) before being accelerated through a 
potential difference, $V$, to acquire a fixed amount of 
kinetic energy, $\KE = zV$.
The accelerated sample is then allowed to drift a
fixed distance, $d$, through a field-free region to a 
detector where the \gls{tof} can be measured.
Because each analyte molecule was given the same
kinetic energy, their velocities in the field-free 
drift region will be determined by their mass through
the relationship for kinetic energy
\begin{equation}
  \KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
	\label{eqn:KE}
\end{equation}
\refeqn{KE} shows that for constant kinetic energy, 
$\KE$, the squared velocity ($v^2$) of each analyte 
molecule is inversely proportional to mass ($m$).
If we let the time spent in the field-free drift region 
(\gls{tof}) be $t$, then $v = \frac{d}{t}$ and as $V$ and $d$ are 
known constants, we see that mass-to-charge ratio 
(\gls{mz}) is a quadratic function of \gls{tof} $t$,
\begin{equation}
\frac{m}{z} = \frac{2t^2V}{d^2}.
\label{eqn:mz_t}
\end{equation}
\refeqn{mz_t} shows how \gls{mz} can effectively be 
measured by flight time --- hence 
\acrfull{tof}-\gls{ms}.
This whole process, from ionisation to detection, is 
illustrated in \reffig{msSchematic}.

	\caption{Schematic describing the acquisition of a 
  mass spectrum in a linear mass spectrometer. 
%   (similar to Fig. 2(a) in \citet{Seeley2011}). 
  From left to right, sample is ionised, accelerated 
  through an electric potential, allowed to

  \gls{mz} which yields a mass spectrum. 
  \label{fig:msSchematic}}
   \end{center}
\end{figure}

The system described above and illustrated in 
\reffig{msSchematic} is a simplification when 
considering most modern instruments.
Specifically, when using \gls{maldi}, the initial laser 
pulse results in a small explosion of ions.
This explosion results in the analyte ions having 
variable initial positions and velocities (kinetic 
energies), and these variations limit the accuracy of 
the mass spectrometer.
A number of improvements to the system described above 
have been made that can compensate for these small 
differences in initial position and energy of analyte 
ions, increasing the accuracy of modern mass 
spectrometers. 
Some notable examples of such improvements include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Delayed Extraction:}
  Variation in the initial positions and energies of 
  analyte ions can be further compensated for by a 
  process called \emph{delayed extraction} 
  \citep{Vestal1995}.
  Delayed extraction involves incorporating a short 
  delay time between the ionising laser pulse and 
  switching on the accelerating electric potential 
  illustrated in \reffig{msSchematic}.
  This delay allows ions with higher initial energy to
  drift further into the mass spectrometer than those
  with lower initial energy before the electric 
  potential is applied.
  The fact that ions with higher initial energy have 
  travelled further into the mass spectrometer when the 
  electric potential is applied means they traverse 
  less distance within the electric field and are given 
  less energy.
  Conversely, ions with lower initial energy 
  traverse more distance through the electric field and 
  are thereby given more energy.
  This process helps compensate for variations in
  initial energies and results in ions leaving the 
  electric potential region and entering the field-free 
  drift region of \reffig{msSchematic} with a more 
  consistent total amount of kinetic energy --- thereby 
  improving the accuracy of the resulting measurements.

\item \textbf{Reflectron Mode:} The system described 
  above and in \reffig{msSchematic} is that of a 
  \gls{tof} mass spectrometer in \emph{linear mode}, 
  so-called because the analyte ions follow a path 
  through the mass spectrometer described by a straight 
  line. 
  Most modern \gls{tof} mass spectrometers still have 
  an option to be operated in linear mode, typically 
  for use in analysing intact proteins, but in practice 
  these instruments are almost always operated in 
  reflectron mode.
  In reflectron mode, after initial acceleration ions
  are `reflected' by a constant electric field at an 
  angle to their initial velocity, causing them to 
  follow a parabolic path and thereby creating a focal 
  point that can compensate for small deviations in 
  initial energy and position of analyte ions 
  \citep{Boesl1992,Kaufmann1993}.
  This reflection step essentially replaces the 
  field-free drift region of \reffig{msSchematic}.
  In addition to compensating for some variability in 
  initial energies and positions, reflectron mode 
  allows for a longer effective drift distance $d$, and
  these two factors combined significantly improve the 
  accuracy with which the \gls{mz} of analyte ions can 
  be measured, and thereby the resolution ultimately 
  achieved.
\end{itemize}
All the data presented in this thesis were collected in
reflectron mode and using delayed extraction.












\subsection{Fractionation}
\label{sec:fractionation}

Proteomics samples are often highly complex ---
containing many thousands of proteins.
Strong signals due to abundant proteins can 
obscure the weaker signals of less abundant proteins, 
making these weaker signals difficult or impossible to 
detect. 
Also, the \gls{mz} values of multiple proteins can 
overlap, making identification difficult.
These complications can be addressed by fractionation 
--- separating analytes in the sample by some physical 
or chemical property prior to \gls{ms} acquisition.
Fractionation can be done at either the protein level,
or at the peptide level, corresponding to fractionation
before or after proteolytic cleavage respectively.
Fractionation has become standard in proteomics, 
see \citet{Wasinger1995}.
\gls{ge} and \gls{lc} are examples of common 
fractionation techniques in proteomics, with \gls{lc} 
being the predominant fractionation technique 
\citep{Gygi2000,Rogowska-Wrzesinska2013}. 
For an overview and review of recent approaches in 
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms}, see \cite{America2008}.
Although we only tangentially incorporate results that
involve fractionation in this work, the results we
do present are from \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} at the peptide 
level.

\gls{ge} typically fractionates on the protein level, 
and separates analytes by size, charge, or both --- as 
is the case in 2D-\gls{ge}, a very popular method in 
proteomics.
This is achieved by using an electric field to 
force molecules through a gel, often polyacrylamide, 
that acts as a `sieve'.
Smaller molecules find that their movement is 
restricted less by the gel media than larger molecules, 
and in this way molecules are separated by size.

\gls{lc} makes use of columns to bind molecules to a 
stationary phase --- an immobile surface with gaps to 
allow solvent to be pushed through.
The molecules are subsequently eluted over time using a
changing gradient of mobile phase solvent.
Traditionally the stationary phase was hydrophilic, 
but `reverse-phase' chromatography is popular in 
proteomics, in which the stationary phase is 
hydrophobic and the hydrophobicity of the mobile phase 
is increased gradually with time.
% In a reverse-phrase \gls{lc} experiment, hydrophobic 
% molecules begin bound to the stationary phase, and are
% gradually eluted by increasing the hydrophobic 
% component of the mobile phase. 
Coupling this fractionation method directly to a mass 
spectrometer (\gls{lc}-\gls{ms}) allows molecules to be 
characterised by \gls{ms} as they elute off the column 
one by one, reducing the complexity of any single 
spectrum tremendously.

Both \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} and 2D-\gls{ge} are very 
powerful methods in terms of their ability to 
characterise and identify proteins in a sample.
However both these methods involve the homogenisation 
of a sample prior to analysis, and this step destroys
any information about the spatial distributions of 
proteins within a sample.
The loss of spatial information in these established 
methods motivated the development of direct tissue 
analysis using \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} 
\citep{Cornett2007,Groseclose2008,Gustafsson2011}.

\section{Histopathology and Formalin Fixation}
\label{sec:FFPEandIHC}

We are interested in the use of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} 
to detect spatial patterns in tissue and so it is  
important to consider other histopathology techniques.
\gls{ihc} is the established `gold standard' for 
mapping the spatial distribution of a protein, and so 
any discussion of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} in the context 
of mapping such spatial distributions requires 
comparison to, and validation by, \gls{ihc}. 
In \refsec{IHC} we briefly introduce histopathology and
\gls{ihc} in comparison to \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.
Ultimately, we discuss how \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} can 
complement the use of these methods.

There are different methods for preserving or `fixing' 
the spatial information in the tissue for analysis.
In the field of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, fresh frozen 
tissue samples have historically been used, but recent 
advances have allowed for the use of \gls{ffpe} tissue.
This has had widespread impact on the field as 
\gls{ffpe} tissue samples can be stored long term 
relatively cheaply, and so large archives of \gls{ffpe}
tissue samples exist.
Access to larger sample sizes via these \gls{ffpe} 
tissue archives has allowed for previously difficult 
research questions to be tackled, as we discuss further
in \refsec{TMAs}.
In \refsec{FFPE} we introduce the concepts underlying 
fresh frozen and \gls{ffpe} tissue samples, including a 
brief comparison of their respective advantages and a 
discussion of the methodological developments that have 
led to \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} analysis of \gls{ffpe} 
tissue. 
All the applications of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} we 
consider in this thesis are on \gls{ffpe} tissue.


\subsection{Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry}
\label{sec:IHC}

Histopathology is the study of the anatomy of tissues
at the microscopic scale, and is typically performed by 
a pathologist, who can often provide diagnostic 
information on a disease by examination of a stained 
section of tissue using a light microscope.
The staining step is important as tissue has little 
inherent contrast and, as well as adding contrast, 
staining can highlight features of interest.
\gls{he} is one of the most common stains used in 
histopathology, highlighting cellular nuclei and 
cytoplasm respectively.
We use images of \gls{he} stained tissue as a 
baseline of spatial structure to compare the 
results of many of our analyses.
In some datasets, we also use 
annotations made by a pathologist on the basis of
\gls{he} stained tissue.

\gls{ihc} refers to the use of an antibody to stain
tissue in an attempt to highlight the corresponding 
antigen (protein). 
Given an antibody for the protein of interest a stain 
is usually achieved either by conjugating the antibody
to an enzyme, such as peroxidase, that can catalyse a 
visible reaction, or by tagging the antibody with a 
fluorophore. 
Regardless of how the antibody is made visible, this 
process allows for the spatial distribution of a 
particular protein to be visualised, given a 
sufficiently specific antibody.

In \gls{ihc} the protein of interest and associated 
antibody are chosen \emph{a priori}, and as such this 
method cannot discover previously unidentified proteins 
with interesting spatial distributions.
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} does not have this limitation as 
it does not target specific proteins --- and so has the 
capacity to lead to the discovery of new biomarkers 
\citep{Schwamborn2010}.
However \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} has only a limited 
ability to identify proteins, so even if a mass is 
found to have an interesting spatial distribution, 
follow-up identification and validation experiments are
required.
Potential identifications for masses of interest can be
inferred by mass-matching to peptides identified in 
parallel \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} experiments on similar 
tissue, as demonstrated by \citet{Meding2012}.
Identification is one of the strengths 
of \gls{lc}-\gls{ms}, but \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} provides no 
information on distribution within the tissue.
As \gls{ihc} is cheaper, easier, and much more 
established than \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, it makes 
sense to find masses with interesting spatial 
distributions by \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, infer 
parent proteins by \gls{lc}-\gls{ms}, and validate the 
spatial distributions of these proteins by \gls{ihc}.

% This paragraph discusses running multiple analyses, 
% MALDI-IMS and IHC for example, on the same tissue 
% sections, and why this can be important. Seemed abit
% tacked on and didnt really add anything much though.

% In order to produce \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, an
% \gls{he} stained image, and to perform \gls{ihc} 
% validation on the same tissue can be problematic.
% The simple solution to this problem is to produce 
% three consequetive sections of tissue, and use one for
% each of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, \gls{he} staining, and
% \gls{ihc} validation. 
% This solution can also be problematic for two reasons:
% first, although consequetive sections should be very 
% similar, there will nonetheless be small differences in 
% the tissue between the three sections, and second, if 
% the tissue samples are precious it may be difficult to 
% justify taking three seperate sections.
% The tissue samples being sufficiently precious that 
% this simple solution becomes problematic is not 
% unrealistic, as a realistic application of these 
% techniques would be to a clinical diagnostic setting 
% where the sample is likely to be from a small biopsy.
% \citet{Deutskens2011} demonstrated that \gls{ihc} can 
% be performed post-acquisition by \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims},
% meaning that both techniques can be used in sequence on 
% the same tissue, meaning there is no real downside to 
% \gls{ihc} validation for a \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} 
% experiment in terms of amount tissue used.



\subsection{FFPE vs Fresh-Frozen}
\label{sec:FFPE}

In this section we briefly discuss the 
differences between \gls{ffpe} and fresh-frozen tissue. 
%
\gls{ffpe} tissue is prepared by first immersing 
tissue in a formalin solution and then embedding the 
tissue in paraffin for storage.
Formaldehyde in the formalin solution creates covalent 
cross-linking bonds between proteins thereby `fixing' 
the tissue by interrupting biochemical reactions, 
preventing decay, and causing the tissue structure to 
stabilise \citep{Fox1985}.
This fixation process can be partially reversed using 
heat in the presence of excess water, and this process 
is often called `antigen retrieval'. 
\gls{ffpe} samples can be stored indefinitely at room 
temperature while proteins (and even nucleic acids) are
still recoverable for detection many years after 
fixation --- making \gls{ffpe} samples a crucial 
resource in retrospective or large-sample studies.
%
Fresh-frozen tissue is prepared by rapidly reducing the 
temperature of the tissue. 
This is typically achieved by placing the 
tissue sample in liquid nitrogen. 
% ($-196\,^{\circ} {\rm C}$). 
Care must be taken to preserve spatial information 
during the cooling process \citep{Schwartz2003}.

\gls{ffpe} tissue can be stored at room temperature,
while fresh frozen tissue requires expensive 
refrigeration, and so \gls{ffpe} tissue is much cheaper 
and easier to store for long periods of time.
For this reason, \gls{ffpe} tissue is the international 
gold standard for tissue sample storage, and large 
archives of \gls{ffpe} tissue exist, often with 
complete patient history and meta-data 
\citep{Hood2005}.
It is usually not feasible to obtain such a large 
number of fresh frozen samples, so when designing an 
experiment for which a large number of samples will be 
needed, using \gls{ffpe} tissue is preferable.
Proteomic analysis of \gls{ffpe} tissue has been 
difficult due to the cross-linking of the proteins 
\citep{Hood2005}, and so until recently, fresh frozen 
tissue has been the most common sample 
for proteomic analysis \citep{Poschmann2009}.
As such, most studies have involved only a small number 
of patients due to the limitations of using fresh 
frozen tissue.
One of the foci in the applications of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} that we consider in \refsec{data} 
is the application to relatively large sample sizes,
and we will consequently use \gls{ffpe} tissue.


Early work on antigen retrieval originates from the 
immunology field, as discussed by \citet{Brown1998}.
First attempts involved simple enzymatic cleavage, but 
\citet{Shi1991} introduced the first method to 
employ additional heating via a microwave source.
Since the work of \citet{Shi1991}, more heat-based 
methods were developed and \citet{Shi2005} discussed 
the standardisation of these methods as they matured in 
the \gls{ihc} field. 
Eventually these developments were transferred into the 
increasingly popular mass spectrometric fields, as 
evidenced in \citet{Palmer-Toy2005} and 
\citet{Crockett2005}.
\citet{Groseclose2008} suggested a  methodology for

of \gls{ffpe} lung tissue.
\citet{Gustafsson2010} applied the methodology of
\citet{Groseclose2008} to \gls{ffpe} ovarian cancer 
tissue, and proposed an improved antigen retrieval 
methodology.
In all the applications we consider in \refsec{data}, 
the methodology of \citet{Gustafsson2010} was used for
antigen retrieval.

\section{MALDI-MSI}
\label{sec:maldiims}

\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} is a technique which collects a 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ms} spectrum from many points on the 
surface of a tissue sample. 
As we have already introduced \gls{maldi}-\gls{ms} in 
\refsec{ms}, here we will focus on the imaging aspect, 
and properties of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} --- i.e. the
process of collecting many \gls{maldi}-\gls{ms} spectra 
from spatially distributed points across the surface 
of a tissue sample.

There are two main goals that use of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} can facilitate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To resolve the spatial distributions of 
  biomolecules of interest within tissue samples.
  \item To acquire data from large numbers of patients
  by use of \glspl{tma}.
\end{itemize}
We discuss advantages and disadvantages of approaches 
to these two main goals in \refsec{spottingspraying} 
and \refsec{TMAs} respectively.
For a review of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} 
see \citet{Seeley2011}.
\citet{Groseclose2007} and \citet{Aoki2007} also 
provide discussions on \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.


Other \gls{ims} methods exist, even within proteomics 
--- \citet{Becker2009,Becker2010} are good examples of 
this, making use of Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled 
Plasma (LA-ICP)-\gls{ims} to study 
metalloproteins.
We focus specifically on \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} due to 
the usefulness of \gls{maldi} in proteomics, as 
discussed in \refsec{maldi}.
The process of taking many measurements on the surface
of a tissue sample by \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} is 
illustrated in \reffig{imagingSchematic}.
In order to collect \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data from a 
tissue section as depicted in 
\reffig{imagingSchematic}, a number of sample 
preparation steps must first be completed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Antigen Retrieval - If \gls{ffpe} tissue is 
  used, cross-linking caused by formalin fixation must 
  be partially reversed prior to analysis, as discussed 
  in \refsec{FFPE}.
  We use the method suggested by 
  \cite{Gustafsson2010} for citric acid antigen 
  retrieval.
  
  \item Enzyme Digestion - It can be useful to digest 
  proteins by use of an enzyme (eg. trypsin) prior
  to acquisition, as the smaller peptides produced by
  enzymatic cleavage can be measured more accurately.
  All the peptide data we consider was acquired after
  trypsin digestion, so the signals we observe are 
  tryptic peptides. 
  For the glycan data a different enzyme, PNGase F, was 
  used to cleave off the asparagine (N)-linked glycans of interest.
  
	\item Internal Calibrants - Known calibrants are 
  added so that each spectrum will contain
  calibrant peaks that can be used for 
  mass-calibration.
  We follow the procedure for internal calibration 
  suggested by \citet{Gustafsson2012}.
  Coincidentally, these internal calibrants can also be 
  useful for data quality control as 
  discussed in \refsec{normalisation}.
	\item Matrix deposition - A matrix, as briefly 
  discussed in \refsec{maldi}, needs to be deposited 
  onto the tissue in order to facilitate ionisation.
  In \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} there are two approaches to 
  this, which we introduce and compare in 
  \refsec{spottingspraying}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spotting vs. Spraying}
\label{sec:spottingspraying}

%Discuss the pros and cons of the two methods (lateral resolution, homogenisation, time (cost), etc.).

Care needs to be taken in all of these sample 
preparation steps to preserve spatial information 
by limiting the mobility of molecules of interest on 
the surface of the tissue \citep{Schwartz2003}. 
In some of the sample preparation steps, most notably 
the internal calibrant and matrix deposition steps, 
limiting the mobility of molecules of interest can be 
achieved by ensuring that reagents are deposited in
non-overlapping `spots'. 
There are two widely accepted approaches for depositing
reagents onto the surface of the tissue, which
we will call `spotting' and `spraying' respectively. 
Here I will briefly introduce these two approaches, 
and discuss their relative advantages and 
disadvantages.
For a more detailed discussion, including some examples 
of instrumentation for various applications, see
\citet{Walch2008}.

\subsubsection{Spraying}

Spraying involves aerosolising the reagents and 
depositing them as a fine mist.
This involves the adjustment of many tuning parameters 
such as droplet size, concentration, and total volume 
deposited as well as the number of spray deposition 
cycles.
There are two main disadvantages to spraying:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Risk of mobilising the molecules of interest ---
  by random chance multiple droplets could merge over a
  significant region of tissue, allowing molecules of 
  interest to disperse across this region.
  
  \item The possibility of gaps --- in order to automate 
  data acquisition spectra are collected from arbitrary 
  positions, some of which may, by random chance, not 
  have matrix on them, and thus no molecules will 
  ionise from those positions.
\end{itemize}
However, the impact of these disadvantages can be 
controlled and greatly reduced by careful optimisation 
of the tuning parameters. 
One of the main advantages of spraying is the ability 
to push the limits of lateral resolution (centre to 
centre distance between spectra acquisition locations).
All the applications we consider use spraying, with 
lateral resolutions ranging from $50\,\mu$m to 
$100\,\mu$m.
\citet{Guenther2011} have pushed the limits of this
technology, demonstrating that it is possible to 
resolve images at lateral resolutions as low as 
$5\,\mu$m under certain conditions.

\subsubsection{Spotting}

Spotting utilises an instrument comparable to an ink-jet 
printer to deposit reagent at pre-allocated positions 
(or spots) across the surface of  the tissue. 
After the antigen retrieval, trypsin, internal 
calibrants, and matrix would be spotted on the same 
grid of positions, and a mass spectrum collected from 
each spot. 
This guarantees that each spot will contain both 
internal calibrants and matrix.
Spotting has the additional advantage that it 
guarantees there will be no overlap between spots, 
thereby restricting the mobility of molecules to within 
each spot.
The disadvantages of spotting when compared to spraying 
are: it is slower (depositing individual spots is time
consuming), the printing instrumentation is more 
expensive, and the minimum achievable lateral 
resolution (centre to centre distance between spots) is 
generally more coarse --- typically $\geq 150\,\mu$m.

In addition to the glycan data we consider in 
\refsec{NglycansDatasets}, \citet{Gustafsson2015} also
considered spotted droplet data.
Spotting can be most useful when the objective is to 
acquire a small number of high-quality spectra and 
a low lateral resolution is not a priority.
This often occurs when the aim is to provide a 
proof-of-principle demonstration of a new methodology 
or technique, as was the case when 
\citet{Gustafsson2015} demonstrated that it was 
possible to use \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} to map the 
spatial distributions of asparagine (N)-linked glycans 
by using PNGase F to cleave the glycans of interest 
from their parent proteins.
The promising large droplet results then prompted the 
follow-up experiment using spraying to achieve better 
lateral resolution, which which we consider in 
\refsec{NglycansDatasets}.



\subsection{TMAs for MALDI-MSI}
\label{sec:TMAs}

% % Microdissection.
% \gls{LC}-\gls{MS} is fundamentally more powerful than 
% \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} in terms of its ability to 
% separate and identify mass signals.
% The advantage of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} over 
% \gls{LC}-\gls{MS} is its ability to preserve spatial 
% information that is typically lost during the 
% homogenising sample preparation steps involved in 
% \gls{LC}-\gls{MS}.
% Some degree of spatial information can be preserved 
% pre-homogenisation by microdissection -- cutting the 
% tissue section into peices and then analysing each 
% piece seperately by \gls{LC}-\gls{MS} \citep{Hood2005}. 
% A microdissection \gls{LC}-\gls{MS} experiment has a 
% significantly limited lateral resolution compared to a 
% \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} experiement, comparable to a 
% large-droplet \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} experiement as 
% mentioned in \refsec{spottingspraying}.
% More importantly however, A microdissection 
% \gls{LC}-\gls{MS} experiment is significantly more 
% expensive and time-consuming. 

A \acrfull{tma} is a physical array of  cylindrical 
tissue cores extracted from blocks of preserved patient
tissue.
Cores are typically less than $2$mm in diameter
\citep{Meding2012} and the number of cores in a single 
\gls{tma} block depends on the size of the cores --- 
smaller diameters allow more cores to fit in a single 
block, but less tissue to be analysed in each core.
Using cores $\sim 1.5$mm in diameter it is typical to 
fit of the order $50$ cores in a single \gls{tma}. 
This arrangement allows for the parallelisation of
tissue analyses, as the entire \gls{tma} can be treated 
as a single sample.
For example, the entire \gls{tma} can be sectioned as 
a single block, resulting in tissue from many samples 
being represented in each section --- an \gls{he} 
stain of such a section is shown in 
\reffig{tmaExample}, including tumour annotations from 
a pathologist.
\glspl{tma} were originally developed in order to
parallelise \gls{ihc} staining, but more recently 
have attracted attention for \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.

Construction of a \gls{tma} involves the arrangement of 
tissue cores from multiple patient samples (biopsies)
into a new `\gls{tma}' block that can then be 
sectioned as one.
The application of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} to \glspl{tma}
allows for data to be collected from a large number of 
patients very quickly --- see 
\citet{Groseclose2008,Steurer2013}.
A one-day sample preparation of sections from such a 
\gls{tma} allows for an overnight \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}
experiment to collect data on more than $50$ cores in 
one $24$ hour period.
This approach is significantly faster than more
traditional tissue analysis approaches, such as 
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms}.
If \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} can be shown to produce diagnostically
relevant information, its speed would allow for it to 
potentially be applied for clinical screening of 
individual samples \citep{Casadonte2011}. 

% Lit Review of people using TMAs and MALDI-IMS for stuff.
% Inge says not relevant here, so ok.

% \citet{Mascini2015,Rauser2010} provide examples of how
% the application of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} to \glspl{tma}
% can produce information relevant to classification 
% problems in breast cancer, and similarly 
% \citet{Djidja2010} proposed a \gls{pca} based 
% classification method for such data, which they 
% demonstrate on pancreatic cancer data.
% In \refsec{endometrialDatasets} we introduce an 
% application of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} to endometrial 
% cancer \glspl{tma} that we will consider in 
% \refchap{classificationApplication}, where we will 
% apply \gls{pca} based methods similar to those proposed 
% by \citet{Djidja2010} as well as some alternatives 
% which we introduce and discuss in 
% \refchap{classificationMethods}.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

We consider datasets from three applications of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ovarian Cancer --- These whole-section data 
  relate to ovarian tumours embedded in peritoneal
  tissue (elements of the internal abdominal wall) from 
  three patients.
  Further details can be found in the work of 
  \citet{Gustafsson2012thesis}. 
  These data contain spectra from both tumour tissue 
  and surrounding non-tumour tissues excised as a 
  `margin of error' around the tumours during surgery.
  These are peptide data and the main interest is to 
  find peptide signals that differentiate between 
  different tissue types, particularly peptides that 
  are present more in tumour than the 
  surrounding non-tumour tissues.
  We approach this in a two-step process, first using
  clustering to separate the tissue types in an 
  automated manner, second using a \gls{dipps}-based
  feature extraction step to find a short-list of 
  potential peptides of interest.
  We introduce and discuss this two step process in 
  \refchap{dipps}.
  In \refsec{datasetComparisons} we then 
  compare these short-lists of tumour-identifying 
  peptides between patients, to separate the 
  within-patient variability from the between-patient 
  variability and detect peptides specific to the 
  short-lists from certain patients --- i.e. peptides 
  that are over-expressed by tumour cells in particular
  patients but not others. 
  In the future, such peptides could form a starting 
  point for experiments investigating individualised 
  treatments, but at this initial stage the ability to 
  detect such peptides acts primarily as a 
  proof-of-principle that can then be followed up.
  
  \item Murine Glycans --- These data relate to sections 
  of murine kidney treated with PNGase F to release 
  asparagine (N)-linked glycans.
  The object of these data is to serve as a 
  proof-of-principle that glycans can effectively be 
  released \emph{in situ} and measured by 
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.
  In \refsec{dataDependant} we demonstrate how the 
  second (\gls{dipps}-based feature extraction) step 
  of the approach introduced in \refchap{dipps} can be
  applied in this context to produce a short-list of 
  potential glycan masses.
  
  \item \glspl{tma} --- We consider two \gls{tma} 
  applications of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, one primary
  application (to endometrial cancer) that we will 
  focus on and a secondary, smaller, application (to 
  vulvar cancer) that we will use primarily to validate
  and replicate results obtained from the endometrial 
  cancer application.
  The endometrial cancer data relate to 
  \glspl{tma} of endometrial cancer, 
  providing access to data from a relatively large 
  number of patients (more than $40$), as discussed in 
  \refsec{TMAs}. 
  The objective is to demonstrate that these data can 
  be used to predict clinically relevant diagnostic 
  information, justifying further research into the use 
  of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} of \glspl{tma} for clinical 
  screening and diagnostics.
  The diagnostic variable of interest is 
  lymph node metastasis status, which we attempt to 
  classify on the basis of the \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}
  data in \refchap{classificationApplication}.
  The secondary vulvar cancer data relate to a similar
  diagnostic variable of interest relating to 
  metastasis, but provide access to data from a 
  smaller number of patients (still more than $20$).
  We will use the vulvar cancer data to investigate 
  whether the conclusions we reach through 
  investigation of the endometrial cancer data can be 
  replicated in an unrelated dataset.

\end{itemize}


All the data originate from \gls{ffpe} tissue samples 
that have been sectioned --- cut into thin 
cross-sections, typically $6-10\,\mu$m thick.
We will use the word `dataset' to mean the data 
collected from one such section of tissue, except where
otherwise specified.
All the data were acquired by \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} at 
the \gls{apc}, but on two different instruments, and 
using different parameters.
Parameter choices involved in 
the data acquisition are shown in \reftab{acqParams}, 
as well as the citations relevant to each application
including several papers we have published in the 
process of pursuing this research.

All the data we will deal with is in `peaklist' format, 
meaning that some pre-processing has already been 
performed to extract the signals of interest from the
raw spectra. This pre-processing has been done in 
proprietary software (flexControl, flexAnalysis, and 
flexImaging, Bruker Daltonik, 
\url{http://www.bruker.com}), and involves a number of 
steps: smoothing (Gaussian kernels), baseline reduction 
(TopHat), and finally peak picking (SNAP).
The SNAP algorithm isolates mono-isotopic peaks and 
defines significant peaks as those peaks with a 
\gls{snr} of two or higher.
These pre-processing and peak-picking methods could be 
improved, and as all our analysis is downstream of the 
peak-picking (that is, it occurs after peak-picking),
any improvements to these pre-processing and 
peak-picking steps could clearly carry through to our
results.
However, the object of most of our work is 
proof-of-principle and so, although interesting, 
optimisation of pre-processing methods falls beyond the 
scope of this work.

In Sections~\ref{sec:ovarianDatasets}, 
\ref{sec:NglycansDatasets} and 
\ref{sec:endometrialDatasets} we introduce and discuss
details for the three applications of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} respectively.
When introducing the details of these applications, we 
also discuss the objectives of each application, and 
the statistical approaches we will use in order to 
address these objectives, in general terms.
In \refsec{statsBackground} we introduce some 
statistics background, in particular introducing the 
terms `clustering' and `classification', giving some 
added context and expanding upon the approaches briefly 
mentioned here in \refsec{data}. 



\subsection{Ovarian Cancer Application}
\label{sec:ovarianDatasets}

\citet{Winderbaum2015} motivate the study of ovarian cancer
by proteomics:
\begin{quote}
``Ovarian cancers are virtually asymptomatic and as a 
result the vast majority of cases are detected when the 
disease has metastasised. 
For these patients, radical surgery and chemotherapy 
are often insufficient to address the disease 
adequately and many patients relapse. 
The combination of late-stage diagnosis and 
unsuccessful treatments makes ovarian cancer the most 
lethal gynaecological cancer, with advanced stage 
patients exhibiting a five year survival rate of less 
than $30\%$  
\citep{Ricciardelli2009,Jemal2011}. 
The keys to addressing ovarian cancer will be: 
increasing our understanding of the mechanisms driving 
cancer progression, identifying molecular markers which 
can predict treatment success and identifying new 
treatment targets. 
As proteins are key functional components of cells and 
tissues, determining protein distributions in cancer 
tissue represents a crucial step in addressing these 
key aims.''

Ovarian cancers are known to be quite heterogeneous 
tissues \citep{Deininger2008}, and this motivates the 
use of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} in acquiring spatial 
information that can de-convolute the inherent 
heterogeneity of the tissue \citep{Gorzolka2014}. 
\citet{Gustafsson2012thesis} describes the acquisition 
of the data we have from a number of embedded ovarian 
tumours --- containing not only tumour tissue, but also
a margin of surrounding non-tumour tissues.
One of our primary aims in considering these data is to
separate the different tissue types, which we do by 
means of the $k$-means clustering.
Further to separating spectra from different tissue 
types, we are interested in the extraction of features 
or variables specific to the tumour tissue and less 
prevalent in the non-tumour tissues.
We present a method for this feature extraction based
on ranking the variables by a statistic which we call
\gls{dipps}, and then selecting the highly-ranked 
variables.
The process we propose for these clustering and feature 
selection steps is described in detail in 
\refchap{dipps}.
Another aim when considering these ovarian cancer data 
is to compare these highly ranked variables across 
multiple datasets from both the same and different 
patients, in an attempt to provide a  
proof-of-principle that differences between patients 
can be found using \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} in this way, 
potentially providing reasons to pursue future cohort 
studies making use of \glspl{tma} to predict treatment 
response.
We consider the results of our combined clustering and
feature selection method on several datasets from the 
same and different patients in detail in 
\refsec{datasetComparisons}.
\refchap{dipps} and \refsec{datasetComparisons} 
represent a more comprehensive view of the results 
published by \citet{Winderbaum2015}, and provide us the 
opportunity to discuss these results in more detail.

The ovarian cancer datasets originate from patients who
were diagnosed with serous ovarian cancer and went 
through surgery to have tumours removed. 
We consider $12$ datasets collected from sections of 
surgically excised ovarian cancer tumours --- $4$ 
from each of $3$ patients, where the $4$ datasets from 
each patient are from multiple tissue sections of 
the same tumour or tissue block.
We will refer to the patients as A, B, and C, and will 
refer to the four datasets from patient A as; A1, A2, 
A3, and A4, and similarly for patients B and C. 
\reftab{imgBasicStats} provides some details for each 
of these datasets, indicating the scale of these data.
The number of empty spectra, that is spectra with no 
peaks, can be used as a heuristic for quality control 
as every spectra, even off-tissue spectra, should 
contain at least the internal calibrants and so a 
spectrum being empty most likely indicates acquisition 
conditions that require examination or improvement --- 
inconsistent matrix crystallisation, for example.
The number of empty spectra shown in 
\reftab{imgBasicStats} are generally very small 
relative to the total number of spectra, indicating no 
obvious problem with the data acquisition, although 
amongst all $12$ datasets C2 and C4 seem to have 
notably more empty spectra than others.
There is no immediately obvious reason why these two 
datasets should be any different to the others, but we 
will notice these empty spectra in further analyses in 
\refchap{dipps}.
% As alluded to in \refsec{statsBackground}, we 
% discretise the \gls{mz} domain and the method we use for 
% doing this in the ovarian cancer datasets is binning, 
% which we explicitly define in \refapp{binning}.

Similar to the methodology of \citet{Meding2012}, 
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms} data was collected in parallel for 
these ovarian cancer samples.
Peptide identities of masses in the 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data can be inferred by matching 
to the masses of peptides identified in the 
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms} data.
Two such peptide masses that we find to be of 
particular interest later in \refchap{dipps}, with 
their parent proteins, are shown in \reftab{massIDs}.
\gls{ihc} validation was also carried out for three
selected proteins, including the two of 
\reftab{massIDs}, and the \gls{ihc} stains for these 
are shown in \reffig{IHCvalidation}.








\subsection{N-Glycan Application (in Murine Kidney)}
\label{sec:NglycansDatasets}

\citet{Gustafsson2015} motivate the study of glycans:
\begin{quote}
``The majority of mammalian secretary and membrane 
proteins are modified through glycosylation: the 
covalent linkage of polysaccharide moieties (i.e., 
glycans) to either serine/ threonine (O-linked) or 
asparagine (N-linked) residues \citep{Pan2011}.''
...
% As such, glycosylation is one of the most common 
% posttranslational modifications (PTM) 
% \citep{Pan2011,Kam2008}. 
% Global analysis of glycans and glycoproteins is 
% currently pursued through glycomics and 
% glycoproteomics, respectively \citep{Kolarich2012}. 
% Glycomics focuses on the isolation and characterization 
% of glycans \citep{Kolarich2012}, while glycoproteomics 
% focuses on the elucidation of information such as the 
% identity of glycosylated proteins, glycan composition, 
% glycosylation site, and the role of the glycoprotein in 
% cellular function and/or dysfunction \citep{Pan2011}.
``Much of the interest in the analysis of protein 
glycosylation stems from the observation of altered 
glycosylation patterns in cancer \citep{Pan2011}. 
An understanding of these alterations could provide 
novel biomarkers of disease as well as new treatment 
targets for anticancer therapies \citep{Abbott2008}.''
\end{quote}

The glycan experiment involved the use of an enzyme 
PNGase F to free N-linked glycans from \gls{ffpe} 
tissue in order to be available for analysis, this 
sample preparation step essentially replaced that of 
the trypsin digestion discussed in \refsec{maldiims}.
The objective of the experiment was to demonstrate the
proof-of-principle that N-linked glycans could be 
detected by \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} on \gls{ffpe} tissue.
As this was a proof-of-principle experiment and not 
yet a study of a clinically relevant disease such as 
cancer (which is intended to be the next application of 
this method), non-precious murine (rodent) kidney 
tissue was used.
\citet{Gustafsson2015} carried out three different 
analyses on these samples: \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} of 
homogenised tissue treated with PNGase F, and both 
large droplet \emph{in situ} \gls{maldi}-\gls{ms} (as
mentioned in \refsec{spottingspraying}), and 
high-resolution \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} on both tissue
treated with PNGase F, and (untreated) control tissue.

For the high-resolution \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data we 
will consider, spectra were collected from two 
comparable regions of tissue, one of which was treated 
with the enzyme PNGase F and the other, `control', 
region was not treated with the enzyme. 
Masses observed in the first region but not in the 
second are expected to be glycan masses, and further 
evidence for their identity as glycans was established
by \citet{Gustafsson2015} using the additional 
\gls{lc}-\gls{ms} and large droplet data.
As this experiment essentially consists of only a 
single \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} dataset, some of the 
decisions made in preprocessing the ovarian cancer 
datasets (where a major objective was to compare 
multiple datasets) are no longer easily justified for 
the glycan dataset.
Specifically, the preprocessing decisions relate to the 
method for discretisation of the \gls{mz} domain, for the
ovarian cancer datasets we propose a naive 
`data-independent' binning approach (explicitly defined 
in \refapp{binning}), as this allows for multiple 
datasets to be combined and compared intuitively.
However when this is not necessary, better approaches 
exist, and in \refsec{dataDependant} we discuss this 
point in more detail, and introduce alternative  
`data-dependent' discretisation methods appropriate for 
the glycan data.
Ultimately we apply the `\gls{dipps}' feature 
extraction approach introduced in \refchap{dipps} to 
select likely glycan mass candidates in the 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, and match them by mass to 
identified glycans from the \gls{lc}-\gls{ms} as shown 
in \reftab{glycan_matches}.












\subsection{TMA Applications}
\label{sec:endometrialDatasets}

\subsubsection{Endometrial Cancer TMAs}
% {\highlightTextAs{incomplete}
% The endometrial data of \cite{Mittal2016} was 
% collected using an Bruker UltrafleXtreme at 
% $2$kHz in positive reflectron mode with a \gls{mz} 
% detection range of $800-4000$, and a centre to 
% centre lateral distance of $60\,\mu$m.
% Acquisition and preprocessing was done through 
% proprietary software (flexControl v3.0.1 and 
% flexImaging v4.0.1, Bruker Daltonik, 
% \url{http://www.bruker.com}).
% Most notable of the preprocessing is peak-picking, 
% consisting of the following steps: 
% smoothing using a Gaussian kernel, baseline reduction 
% using the `TopHat' method, peak-picking/deisotoping 
% using the \SNAP method, and finally setting a 
% \gls{snr} threshold of two.
% }


As mentioned in \refsec{TMAs}, an exciting application 
of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} is to \glspl{tma} --- as this
allows data from large cohorts of patients to be
collected rapidly, potentially allowing difficult
diagnostic and prognostic problems to be addressed.
The problem we will consider is that of diagnosing 
\gls{lnm} in patients with endometrial cancer.


\citet{Winderbaum2016} motivate the classification of 
\gls{lnm} in endometrial cancer:
\begin{quote}
``Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological 
malignancy in Australia with $2256$ diagnosed cases in
$2010$ and $381$ associated deaths in $2011$ 
\cite{AIHW2012}. 
The presence or absence of \acrfull{lnm} 
is the most important prognostic factor in endometrial 
cancer as patients with localised disease have a $5$ 
year survival rate of $96\%$, which drops to just 
$17\%$ for patients with metastatic disease 
\cite{Rungruang2012}. 
Accurately staging endometrial cancer is difficult and 
a large percentage of patients are misclassified prior 
to treatment \cite{Jacques1998}. 
Although the presence of \gls{lnm} is confirmed in only 
around $15\%$ of cases \cite{Morrow1991,Creasman2006}, 
the majority of endometrial cancer patients undergo 
radical treatment including the removal of pelvic lymph 
nodes as a precautionary measure to compensate for our 
current inability to accurately stage the disease. 
Lymph node removal is associated with significant 
complications including lower extremity lymphoedema, 
which has been described in up to $38\%$ of patients 
\cite{Todo2010}. 
A classification system based around predictive tissue 
markers of metastasis would greatly benefit stage I 
endometrial cancer patients by helping determine 
optimal treatment strategies that avoid unnecessary, 
invasive procedures.''
\end{quote}

\gls{lnm} is highly predictive of survival but can be 
difficult to diagnose pre-surgery.
Clinical variables such as grade, size, and depth of 
myometrium invasion  are sometimes available 
pre-surgery but do not correlate well enough with 
\gls{lnm} to allow accurate prediction --- see
\reftab{tmaPatientBasicStats}.
We aim to demonstrate that it is possible to improve on 
this prediction by applying suitable classification 
methods to \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data from \glspl{tma}.

If a patient is \gls{lnm} positive and they do not have
their lymph nodes excised with their primary tumour the
cancer is very likely to recur.
Generally the lymph nodes are excised at the same time 
as the primary tumour, as it is difficult to diagnose 
the \gls{lnm} status pre-surgery and the risk of 
leaving any potentially \gls{lnm} positive lymph nodes 
outweighs the additional invasiveness of the surgery to 
remove them.
In addition to \gls{lnm} status potentially providing 
more accurate prognostic prediction due to its 
importance to survival, being able to diagnose
\gls{lnm} status could potentially contribute to the
individualisation of patient treatments.
Patients who are negative for \gls{lnm} could be 
subjected to less invasive surgery as their lymph nodes 
would not need to be removed.
Reduction in the invasiveness of the surgery could then
have positive carry-on effects on post-surgery recovery 
time and quality of life.

The endometrial cancer datasets we consider originate
from $\Sexpr{length(unique(p))}$ patients diagnosed 
with endometrial cancer who had been through surgery to 
have their tumours excised.
Two cylindrical $1.5$mm diameter tissue cores from each 
patients primary tumour were taken and the cores 
arranged into two \gls{tma} blocks --- each \gls{tma} 
block consisting of a $7 \times 9$ grid of cores, 
including some control cores and some empty positions.
These \gls{tma} blocks were then sectioned.
We consider $4$ datasets, two sections of each of the 
two \gls{tma} blocks.
We call the two \gls{tma} blocks `EA' and `EB' 
respectively.
We will denote the two datasets from EA EA1 and EA2, 
and similarly denote the two datasets from EB EB1 and 
EB2.
Although each core is taken from primary tumour tissue,
some sections of some cores still have non-tumour 
tissue or are entirely missing due to the three 
dimensional nature of the cores and the heterogeneity 
of the tumours. 
In order to address this potential tissue heterogeneity
each section was also \gls{he} stained and the tumour 
tissue was manually annotated by a pathologist.
Similarly to \reftab{imgBasicStats},  
\reftab{tmaBasicStats} provides some details for these 
datasets.
The additional column `\# Cancer Spectra' gives the 
total number of spectra from regions annotated as 
tumour tissue by the pathologist.
Notice that the total number of cancer spectra is 
significantly smaller than the number of spectra total
--- this is likely because of both small margins of 
off-tissue regions being acquired, and due to the 
significant heterogeneity of the tissue cores.

In the ovarian cancer data we refer to datasets as they 
conveniently separate the data into biological and 
technical replicates.
However in the endometrial cancer data the goal is to 
make predictions about patients, and many patients are 
represented in each dataset.
We combine all four of the datasets described in
\reftab{tmaBasicStats}, and in our analysis we will 
partition these data by patient.
Also, after closer inspection of the clinical records
it was determined that several patients represented in
the \glspl{tma} are not comparable to the others for
the purposes of predicting \gls{lnm} --- belonging to a 
different sub-type of cancer expected to have very 
different molecular composition and behaviour.
Data from these patients will be completely ignored, 
and after having removed these inappropriate patients 
we are left with data from 
$\Sexpr{nrow(subset(clin_df,Suitable & !is.na(match(clin_df$Patient,p))))}$ 
patients, 
$\Sexpr{sum(subset(clin_df,Suitable & !is.na(match(clin_df$Patient,p)))$LNM)}$ 
of which are \gls{lnm} positive.
\reftab{tmaPatientBasicStats} shows some clinical 
variables of interest as well as details similar to 
\reftab{imgBasicStats} and \reftab{tmaBasicStats} for 
these 
$\Sexpr{nrow(subset(clin_df,Suitable & !is.na(match(clin_df$Patient,p))))}$ 
patients.

We will approach the question of predicting \gls{lnm} 
on the basis of the \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data using 
the framework of classification. 
In \refchap{classificationMethods} we introduce a 
variety of classification methods from the literature, 
some established, and one quite recent.
We also discuss the difficulties in classification of 
such high-dimensional data, and present two different 
approaches to dimension reduction, the comparison of 
which is the focus of \citet{Winderbaum2016}.
We also discuss our approach to preprocessing these 
data, and our novel approach to what we call 
`normalisation' that could potentially improve 
classification results.
After having introduced all these methods in 
\refchap{classificationMethods}, we apply them to the 
endometrial cancer data in 
\refchap{classificationApplication}, and discuss the 
results in detail.
Finally we conclude that useful information that can be
used to improve diagnosis of \gls{lnm} status can be 
obtained from these data in a variety of ways.
The variable reduction method suggested in
\citet{Winderbaum2016} works by ranking variables and 
selecting the highly-ranked ones for use in 
classification. 
This approach has the additional advantage that 
highly-ranked variables can be further investigated as 
potential biomarkers for \gls{lnm}, and we consider 
some promising variables with which to begin this 
process in \refsec{opt_opt}.

\subsubsection{Vulvar Cancer TMAs}


Vulvar cancer is another gynaecological cancer for 
which, similar to endometrial cancer, \gls{lnm} is 
highly predictive of prognosis and important to the 
choice of treatment.

% The following is a quote from Chao's `failed' manuscript,

% ``In the United States $5150$ new vulva cancer cases 
% were diagnosed and $1080$ deaths from this disease were

%

% \gls{lnm} is a crucial factor in the prognosis and

% However, conventional surgical-pathological variables 
% of the primary tumour, such as tumour size, depth of

% 
% Ramaswamy et al. demonstrated that a gene-expression program of metastasis is present in the bulk of a primary tumour, challenging the idea that metastasis originates from rare cells within the tumour which have acquired an exclusive ability to metastasize by random mutations [9].  Moreover, in recent years a number of proteomics approaches have identified protein signatures from primary tumours to accurately predict lymph node metastasis, overall survival or disease reoccurrence [10-15]. Previous studies on vulvar cancer development have mainly focused on exploring the efficiency of existing gynaecological cancer biomarkers, for example mutations in p53 have been shown to promote the development of vulvar cancer [16]. However, the mechanism of vulvar cancer progression and invasion remains unclear. Although several other cancer biomarkers, such as CA125 and Cyclin D1 show a strong correlation with vulvar cancer progression, they are not sensitive nor specific enough to reliably discriminate cancer stages or predict metastasis [17, 18]. Gene sequencing and immunohistochemical staining have been performed on vulvar cancer, but have not identified any suitable cancer biomarkers [19, 20].

In \refchap{classificationApplication} we compare 
different approaches to the classification of the 
endometrial cancer data described above.
Ultimately we note that certain approaches tend to 
perform better than others and it is of interest to 
validate that these trends can be reproduced in a 
different context.
We will use the smaller vulvar cancer dataset to 
reproduce all the analyses included in 
\refchap{classificationApplication} in order to 
investigate which trends are reproduced in this second
dataset, and which are not.
The results of classification on the vulvar cancer data 
are included in \refapp{vulvar}, and discussed in 
\refsec{DAconclusions}.

The vulvar data, similarly to the endometrial cancer
described above, consists of multiple sections from two 
\glspl{tma}, but fewer patients are represented in the
vulvar \glspl{tma} as compared with the endometrial.
The endometrial data represents information from $43$ 
patients relevant to this study, but the vulvar data 
represents information from only $28$ patients.

\section{Statistics Background}
\label{sec:statsBackground}

As mentioned above, the data we will consider is of 
peaklist form. 
Peaklist data does not fit into the standard 
statistical paradigm of `observations' and `variables'
in an obvious way, as the data simply consist of peaks
with \gls{mz} values, several other characteristics (such 
as peak height or intensity, integrated area, and
\gls{snr}), and labels indicating the 
spectra from which the peaks originated.

In each application we construct observations and 
variables from the peaklists in a different way 
appropriate to the particular context.
In many contexts our observations correspond to 
spectra as is common in the analysis of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, but in the endometrial data 
for example our observations correspond to patients. 
The variables will always be some discretisation of the 
\gls{mz} domain --- where each variable corresponds to an 
\gls{mz} interval and peaks are grouped based on which 
variable or \gls{mz} interval they fall into.
We will present different approaches to discretisation 
of the \gls{mz} domain, each with advantages and 
disadvantages, and will use different approaches in 
different applications.
The values of these variables for any given spectrum
then correspond to a particular characteristic of the 
peaks in that spectrum within the relevant \gls{mz} 
interval.
Characteristics that can correspond to the values of 
the variables include: the intensity of a peak, the 
integrated area of the peak, \gls{snr} of 
the peak, and binary values coding the presence or 
absence of a peak. 
In cases when multiple peaks from a single spectrum 
occur in the same \gls{mz} interval, these values can be 
averaged, or the maximum value taken, but we will 
choose sufficiently small \gls{mz} intervals such that 
multiple peaks from the same spectrum should not occur
in the same \gls{mz} interval.
In \refsec{binSizeChoice} we discuss how to choose 
\gls{mz} intervals that are sufficiently small such 
that multiple peaks from the same spectrum do not occur 
in the same \gls{mz} interval.
We will consider each of these options for values of 
the variables in different applications.

In each of the options discussed above, the decisions
about how to discretise the \gls{mz} domain into variables 
and what objects correspond to observations, allow us 
to represent the data as a $d \times n$ data matrix 
$\mData$, where rows correspond to variables and 
columns to observations.
Representing these data in this form allows us to draw 
on the methods from the multivariate statistics 
literature.
Two such methods we will consider in some detail are
clustering, and classification.
We introduce these two methods, along with some 
associated concepts and a little discussion of the 
literature, in \refsec{statsBackgroundClus} and
\refsec{statsBackgroundClas} respectively.
Note that we will repeat much of the discussion from
\refsec{statsBackgroundClas} in \refsec{DAmethods}, 
where we discuss the particular classification methods 
we will use in more detail.
Similarly we will repeat some of the discussion from 
\refsec{statsBackgroundClus} in \refsec{kmeans},
where we discuss the particular clustering method we 
will use in more detail.

\subsection{Clustering, Similarity, and Distance}
\label{sec:statsBackgroundClus}

Clustering is a field in which the objective is to
group (usually partition) observations into `clusters' 
such that observations in the same cluster are more 
`similar' to each other than observations from 
different clusters. See \citet{Jain1999} for a review
on clustering.

In different applications the term `similar' can be 
interpreted in different ways but a general way to 
discuss it is in terms of a distance --- two 
observations are `similar' if the distance between them 
is small.
Distance can be defined more precisely, for example as 
a pseudometric (\refdef{distance}). 
\begin{defn}
\emph{\textbf{Distance (Pseudometric):}} 
a non-negative function $D$ such that for a set $S$, 
$D: S \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and for every 
$x,y,z \in S$,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $D(x,x) = 0$,
  \item $D(x,y) = D(y,x)$, and %(symmetric)
  \item $D(x,z) \leq D(x,y) + D(y,z)$. %(triangle inequality)
\end{enumerate}
\label{def:distance}
\end{defn}
The word distance is sometimes used to mean any 
function $D: S \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such 
that smaller values of $D(x,y)$ indicate $x$ and $y$ 
are more `similar', for some intuitive interpretation 
of the term `similar'.
This more vague usage of the word `distance' is more 
general and includes functions that are not 
pseudometrics but could still be meaningfully used in 
any of the places we use pseudometrics.
That said, all the distances we use are 
pseudometrics, so in the context of this thesis the two 
usages of the word `distance' are interchangeable and 
we simply use the more precise pseudometric definition 
(\refdef{distance}) to avoid confusion.

Although we use several other distances later, in the 
context of clustering we focus on three distances in
particular: the Euclidean distance (or $L^2$ norm), the 
cosine distance (\refdef{Dcos}), and the Hamming 
distance (\refdef{Dham}). 
\begin{defn}
\emph{\textbf{Cosine Distance:}}
$D_{cos} : \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow [0,2]$, such that
\begin{equation}
  D_{cos}(\bm{x},\bm{y}) = 1 - \frac{\bm{x} \cdot \bm{y}}{\sqrt{(\bm{x} \cdot \bm{x})(\bm{y} \cdot \bm{y})}}.
\end{equation}
\label{def:Dcos}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
\emph{\textbf{Hamming Distance:}}
$D_{Ham} : \{0,1\}^d \times \{0,1\}^d \rightarrow [0,d]$, such that
\begin{equation}
  D_{Ham}(\bm{x},\bm{y}) = d - \bm{x} \cdot \bm{y} - (1-\bm{x}) \cdot (1-\bm{y}).
\end{equation}
\label{def:Dham}
\end{defn}
The Euclidean distance allows `similar' to be 
interpreted as `spatially nearby', and as such is 
useful in many clustering applications.
Although there are more general definitions for the 
Hamming distance than \refdef{Dham}, we restrict the 
domain to $d$-dimensional binary vectors $\{0,1\}^d$, 
as this is the context in which we will use the Hamming
distance. 
It is interesting to note that, in this restricted 
domain of binary vectors, the Hamming distance is 
actually equivalent to the squared Euclidean distance, 
i.e. $D_{Ham} = D_{Euc}^2$.








There are many different approaches to clustering, see
\citet[Chapter 6]{Koch2013} and references therein.
One popular choice is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo 
methods to estimate mixture model parameters --- for 
references to this approach see 
\citet{McLachlan1988,Peel2000}.
\citet{Xu2005} review more clustering approaches, 
including so-called `fuzzy' clustering and neural 
network based methods.
One approach to clustering of particular note due to 
its popularity in the analysis of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} 
is that described by \citet{Deininger2008}, which 
combines `supervised' and `unsupervised' steps, and is 
described as as `semi-supervised' by 
\citet{Deininger2008}.
Due to the popularity of such semi-supervised 
approaches in the \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} context we will 
briefly describe the approach of \citet{Deininger2008}, 
including a brief discussion of agglomerative 
hierarchical clustering that forms a component of it, 
although we do not pursue the idea further.
Finally we will briefly discuss the $k$-means approach, 
which we discuss in more detail in \refsec{kmeans},
as this is the clustering approach we will primarily 
rely on in this work.

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is an approach in 
which each observation can be thought of as beginning 
in a separate cluster, and an iterative process is 
implemented such that at each iteration two clusters, 
chosen due to being the `most similar' in some sense, 
are combined.
The total number of clusters is reduced by one in each 
iteration.
This process ends either when a predefined number of 
clusters is reached or after $n-1$ steps when all 
observations are in the same cluster.
Hierarchical clustering such as this can be visualised 
in a dendrogram or hierarchical tree, describing the 
order in which clusters were combined. 
Sometimes the dendrogram representing a hierarchical 
clustering is informative, such as in the context 
described by \citet{Winderbaum2012}.
In the context of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} such a 
dendrogram is difficult to interpret due to the spatial 
information not being represented in the dendrogram.
A specific partition of the observations into clusters 
can be plotted spatially and thus interpreted usefully.
In order to produce a specific partition using standard
hierarchical clustering methods a predefined number of 
clusters needs to be chosen, but justifying this choice
can be difficult.


So-called `semi-supervised' methods popular in the 
analysis of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, such as that 
described by \citet{Deininger2008}, produce a 
particular set of clusters by first visualising a 
standard, unsupervised, agglomerative clustering in a 
dendrogram and then allowing the user to 
recursively open branches in the dendrogram --- 
essentially performing a `supervised' divisive 
clustering step where the choice of which cluster to 
split in each case is determined by the user.
Beginning with the single cluster containing all 
observations the user `opens' clusters, splitting them 
in two, and thus effectively moves down through the 
dendrogram (splitting the observations into more and 
more clusters) until the user believes they have 
reached a meaningful set of clusters. 
What the user determines to be a meaningful set of 
clusters is usually judged on the basis of the 
histology of the tissue with the aid of a \gls{he} 
stain as described in \refsec{IHC}, but this process is 
subjective nonetheless.
This combination of unsupervised hierarchical clustering
and user-determined steps is what earns these methods 
the term `semi-supervised'.
We will not consider results from such semi-supervised
methods, or any hierarchical clustering methods at all, 
instead favouring the $k$-means approach described 
below, which compared to hierarchical methods is more 
computationally efficient.

$k$-means is an alternative approach to that of 
hierarchical clustering that attempts to find an optimum 
partition of the observations into $k$ clusters such 
that observations in the same cluster are `more 
similar' than observations in different clusters in 
some sense.
We give details on the $k$-means algorithm in 
\refsec{kmeans}.
In comparison to the semi-supervised approaches 
described above, $k$-means is an entirely unsupervised
method.
We make extensive use of $k$-means to separate tissue 
types in the ovarian cancer data, where we know
reasonable values of $k$ to be the number of different 
tissue types present, which is easily determined from 
the \gls{he} stains.

These different clustering approaches each have 
advantages and disadvantages, and both hierarchical 
and $k$-means clustering are used in the analysis of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, as \citet{Jones2012} 
discuss.
We favour the $k$-means approach, as its unsupervised 
nature allows us to repeat many computations in 
parallel, and it is more computationally efficient than
hierarchical methods as it does not need to generate 
full dendrograms.
However it should be noted that hierarchical approaches 
have their uses as well, as discussed at length by 
\citet{Alexandrov2012} and references therein.


\subsection{Classification}
\label{sec:statsBackgroundClas}

Classification, sometimes called discriminant analysis, 
is a field that concerns the differentiation of data 
belonging to several classes 
\citep[Chapter 4]{Koch2013}.
Classification can be subdivided into two steps: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constructing a classification rule capable of 
  assigning a class label to an observation.
  The construction of the rule is done on the basis of 
  data with known class membership (labels, identifying 
  the class to which each observation belongs), 
  sometimes called `training' data.
  This construction step is often referred to as the 
  `training' or `learning' step.
  \item Applying a rule to assign a class label to 
  an observation (or observations). 
  This step can be further subdivided into one of two cases: 
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item applying the rule to an observation of 
    unknown class membership for which a real-world 
    decision needs to be made (prediction), or 
    \item applying the rule to observations of known 
    class membership in order to assess the performance 
    of the rule (sometimes called `testing').
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that there are a plethora of 
approaches to classification, and we only consider a 
very limited selection, which we describe in 
\refsec{DAmethods}.
Popular approaches to classification not represented 
in this work include random forests (see 
\citet{Breiman2001} and references therein) and 
\glspl{svm} (see \citet{Scholkopf1998,Cristianini2000} 
and references therein).
Special consideration of the analysis of binary data 
has dated back as far as \citet{Cox1972}, and although
we consider classification of binary data, we do not 
consider classification approaches specifically 
developed for binary data, although such approaches do
exist (see \citet{Lee2011} and references therein). 
Comparison of a broader selection of classification 
approaches for binary data, such as that of
\citet{Asparoukhov2001} is needed, but is beyond the 
scope of this work.
Comparisons of a broader range of classification 
approaches (without restricting to binary data) have 
been made on \gls{maldi}-\gls{ms} data by 
\citet{Wu2003} and on cDNA/mRNA microarray data by 
\citet{Dudoit2002} but an extensive comparison of 
classification approaches on \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data 
specifically is lacking.
Extensive comparisons of classification approaches is 
lacking, but there has been significant 
interest in the classification of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} 
data in the literature \citep{Casadonte2011}.
Some research of particular interest from the 
literature includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \citet{Mascini2015} suggest using 
  \gls{pca}-\gls{lda} for the classification of 
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, and this is one of the 
  options we consider in 
  \refchap{classificationApplication}.
  
  \item \citet{Rauser2010} consider \gls{svm} and 
  Artificial Neuronal Network approaches to the 
  classification of top-down (protein level) 
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data of fresh frozen tissue --- 
  a fundamentally different approach to the bottom up 
  (peptide level) data from \gls{ffpe} tissue that we 
  consider.
  
  \item \citet{Casadonte2011} discuss the importance of 
  classification applied to \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data 
  acquired on \glspl{tma} constructed from \gls{ffpe}
  tissue. The endometrial cancer data we consider falls 
  in this category, as do the data considered by 
  \citet{Groseclose2008} and \citet{Djidja2010}, who
  apply univariate dimension reduction approaches 
  followed by \gls{svm} classification and \gls{pca} 
  based classification respectively.
\end{itemize}

Although there is need for a comparison of a broader 
range of classification approaches for 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, this is beyond the scope of 
this work --- we aim to fulfil a similar role to the 
work of \citet{Djidja2010}, \citet{Mascini2015} and 
\citet{Groseclose2008} on the classification of 
\gls{tma} \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data.
Each of these papers considers the application of a 
particular classification approach on each of their 
respective datasets.
We consider the application of a slightly wider variety
of approaches, comparing the results of these 
approaches and suggesting approaches that seem to be 
promising on the basis of these results.

We will restrict attention to two-class problems 
and linear classification approaches, but it should be 
noted that multi-class and non-linear alternatives 
exist and are simply not discussed here.
As we will only deal with linear two-class 
classification, we introduce some notation in 
\refeqn{linearDAintro} specific to that scenario, and 
which we will use as a framework for comparing 
classification approaches within these restrictions.

% In the context of linear classification approaches, 
% training a rule essentially consists of finding an
% $(d-1)$-dimensional hyperplane in the $d$-dimensional 
% sample space that `best' separates the two classes in 
% some sense.
% This is equivalent finding a direction, or a line 
% through the origin, normal to the hyperplane and a 
% scalar cutoff value -- the intersection of the line and 
% the hyperplane.
% Testing such a classification rule then consists of 
% identifying which side of the hyperplane an observation 
% is, and assigning it the appropriate class label. 
% This is equivalent to projecting the observation into 
% the line and determining if the projection is less than 
% or greater than the cutoff value.
% Many approaches, such as \glspl{svm} discuss linear 
% classification from the perspective of 
% identifying a separating hyperplanes, and we will touch 
% on this in our discussion of \gls{dwd} in \refsec{DWD}.
% However primarily we will discuss linear classification
% from the perspective of lines identified by direction 
% vectors with associated scalar cutoffs. 
First, let us consider the canonical Fisher's \gls{lda}
for some intuition on linear classification.
In the context of linear classification approaches, 
\citet{Fisher1936} proposed to project the data onto a 
direction which leads to the best separation into two 
parts of the one-dimensional projected data.  
Equivalently Fisher’s proposal results in a vector of 
weights, $\bm{d}$, such that the linear combination of 
the data with this vector yields one-dimensional 
quantities which, ideally, fall into two disjoint 
intervals.
In practice the projected one-dimensional data may not 
separate completely into separate intervals, and an 
offset or scalar value $\beta$ is used to represent the 
value that achieves the best separation.




To state this more formally, first let $\mData$ denote 
a $d \times n$ data matrix of $n$ observations with 
known class labels coded as $-1$ or $+1$. 
All the rules we will consider use the data $\mData$ 
and the associated class labels to `train' a rule by 
finding a $d \times 1$ vector $\bm{d}$ and a scalar
$\beta$. This rule then assigns class label 
$\tau(\bm{x})$ to a $d \times 1$ observation $\bm{x}$ 
in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\tau(\bm{x}) = \left \{ \begin{array}{lcl}
+1 & \text{ if } & \bm{d}^T\bm{x} + \beta > 0 \\
-1 & \text{ if } & \bm{d}^T\bm{x} + \beta < 0
\end{array} \right . .
\label{eqn:linearDAintro}
\end{equation}
The notation of \refeqn{linearDAintro} is repeated in 
\refeqn{linearDA}, where we explore these ideas in more
detail and also present an example application of 
Fisher's \gls{lda} to illustrate the intuition behind 
these concepts.
% does not address the case
% when $\bm{d}^T\bm{x} + \beta = 0$, as in this 
% unlikely case the observation $\bm{x}$ is not assigned
% a class label.
The difference between the classification approaches 
we discuss in Sections~\ref{sec:LDA}, \ref{sec:NB} and 
\ref{sec:DWD} essentially boils down to different 
approaches to choosing $\bm{d}$ and $\beta$.
