  Abstract                 = {Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest female reproductive tract malignancy in Western countries. Less than 25% of cases are diagnosed when the cancer is confined, however, pointing to the critical need for early diagnostics for ovarian cancer. Identifying the changes that occur in the glycome of ovarian cancer cells may provide an avenue to develop a new generation of potential biomarkers for early detection of this disease. We performed a glycotranscriptomic analysis of endometrioid ovarian carcinoma using human tissue, as well as a newly developed mouse model that mimics this disease. Our results show that the N-linked glycans expressed in both nondiseased mouse and human ovarian tissues are similar; moreover, malignant changes in the expression of N-linked glycans in both mouse and human endometrioid ovarian carcinoma are qualitatively similar. Lectin reactivity was used as a means for rapid validation of glycan structural changes in the carcinomas that were predicted by the glycotranscriptome analysis. Among several changes in glycan expression noted, the increase of bisected N-linked glycans and the transcripts of the enzyme responsible for its biosynthesis, GnT-III, was the most significant. This study provides evidence that glycotranscriptome analysis can be an important tool in identifying potential cancer biomarkers.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Systematic differences due to experimental features of microarray experiments are present in most large microarray data sets. Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms. These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of microarray data.Results: We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within microarray data sets. Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of âDistance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)â is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.Availability: Matlab software to perform DWD can be retrieved from https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/Supplementary information: The complete figures that represent the cluster diagrams in Figure 6 and other figures are available at https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/},

Furthermore, the behaviour of spontaneous and induced delayed ion decay in a reflection spectrometer is discussed. Knowledge of this behaviour has been used to develop scanning techniques for laser tandem mass spectrometry. Additional applications of laser reflectron mass spectrometry discussed in this review are the measurement of ion decay times, mass spectrometry combined with laser desorption from surfaces and the laser mass spectrometry of isomers.},

This imposes processing techniques using dedicated informatics tools to be used since manual data interpretation is excluded. This work proposes and summarizes an approach that utilizes a multivariable analysis of MSI data. The multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysisâsymbolic discriminant analysis, can remove and highlight specific m / z from the spectra in a specific region of interest. This approach facilitates data processing and provides better reproducibility, and thus, broadband acquisition for MALDI-MSI should be considered an effective tool to highlight biomarkers of interest. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the hierarchical classification of biomarkers by analyzing studies of clusters obtained either from digested or undigested tissues and using bottom-up and in-source decay strategies for in-tissue protein identification. This provides the possibility for the rapid identification of specific markers from different histological samples and their direct localization in tissues. We present an example from a prostate cancer study using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.},

  Abstract                 = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning : Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference , ***, 148â156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  Abstract                 = { Proteomics analyses have been exploited for the discovery of novel biomarkers for the early recognition and prognostic stratification of cancer patients. These analyses have now been extended to whole tissue sections by using a new tool, that is, MALDI imaging. This allows the spatial resolution of protein and peptides and their allocation to histoanatomical structures. Each MALDI imaging data set contains a large number of proteins and peptides, and their analysis can be quite tedious. We report here a new approach for the analysis of MALDI imaging results. Mass spectra are classified by hierarchical clustering by similarity and the resulting tissue classes are compared with the histology. The same approach is used to compare data sets of different patients. Tissue sections of gastric cancer and non-neoplastic mucosa obtained from 10 patients were forwarded to MALDI-Imaging. The in situ proteome expression was analyzed by hierarchical clustering and by principal component analysis (PCA). The reconstruction of images based on principal component scores allowed an unsupervised feature extraction of the data set. Generally, these images were in good agreement with the histology of the samples. The hierarchical clustering allowed a quick and intuitive access to the multidimensional information in the data set. It allowed a quick selection of spectra classes representative for different tissue features. The use of PCA for the comparison of MALDI spectra from different patients showed that the tumor and non-neoplastic mucosa are separated in the first three principal components. MALDI imaging in combination with hierarchical clustering allows the comprehensive analysis of the in situ cancer proteome in complex human cancers. On the basis of this cluster analysis, classification of complex human tissues is possible and opens the way for specific and cancer-related in situ biomarker analysis and identification. },

  Abstract                 = { A reliable and precise classification of tumors is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer. cDNA microarrays and high-density oligonucleotide chips are novel biotechnologies increasingly used in cancer research. By allowing the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously, microarray experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among tumors and hence to a finer and more informative classification. The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification. This article compares the performance of different discrimination methods for the classification of tumors based on gene expression data. The methods include nearest-neighbor classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees. Recent machine learning approaches, such as bagging and boosting, are also considered. The discrimination methods are applied to datasets from three recently published cancer gene expression studies. },

  Abstract                 = {A novel method for high-throughput proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue microarrays (TMA) is described using on-tissue tryptic digestion followed by MALDI imaging MS. A TMA section containing 112 needle core biopsies from lung-tumor patients was analyzed using MS and the data were correlated to a serial hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained section having various histological regions marked, including cancer, non-cancer, and normal ones. By correlating each mass spectrum to a defined histological region, statistical classification models were generated that can sufficiently distinguish biopsies from adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma biopsies. These classification models were built using a training set of biopsies in the TMA and were then validated on the remaining biopsies. Peptide markers of interest were identified directly from the TMA section using MALDI MS/MS sequence analysis. The ability to detect and characterize tumor marker proteins for a large cohort of FFPE samples in a high-throughput approach will be of significant benefit not only to investigators studying tumor biology, but also to clinicians for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {\{MALDI\} \{MS\} imaging is a powerful tool to visualize the spatial distribution of endogenous biomolecules such as lipids or neuropeptides. Direct identification of analytes is often difficult due to the complexity of biological tissue samples. Today reliable analyte identification is routinely done with mass spectrometers featuring high mass resolving power, high mass accuracy and MS/MS capability. These mass spectrometers, however, typically have a rather poor spatial resolution when used in \{MALDI\} \{MS\} imaging experiments. In this work a linear ion trap orbital trapping mass spectrometer combined with an in-house developed atmospheric pressure \{MALDI\} imaging ion source was used to image neuropeptides in mouse pituitary gland with a spatial resolution of 5 Î¼m. Ten neuropeptides were identified by their accurate mass in the mass range up to 2500 u via targeted database search. The ion images of the peptides show down to the cellular level that their appearances within the pituitary gland are restricted to accurately defined tissue types. This is in excellent agreement with the gland's structure and biological function. The identity of the neuropeptides was confirmed by additional MS/MS measurements from single 10 Î¼m sample spots, obtained directly from tissue. Furthermore, MS/MS imaging of two different peptides at 10 Î¼m spatial resolution resulted in product ion images, which were in good accordance with the distributions of their peptide precursor ions, confirming their identity and excluding possible analyte interferences. Since the method offers high performance mass spectrometry in combination with high spatial resolution, it appears to be ideally suited for imaging peptide signatures on a cellular level with high confidence in identification and with high sensitivity. },

  Abstract                 = { Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful technology for mapping distributions of biological molecules like proteins and peptides within tissue sections. It is therefore potentially extremely useful for the analysis of pathological conditions such as neoplastic diseases. The use of IMS is typically limited to fresh frozen tissue specimens. However, there is a high interest in the possibility of being able to analyze the tissue proteome of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens that have been stored together with the clinicopathological information of patients in huge archives over many decades. We have therefore developed an antigen-retrieval protocol using a high temperature citric acid buffer to allow partial reversal of FFPE protein cross-linking. Coupled with automated deposition of trypsin and matrix, our method allows the generation of meaningful peptide ion distribution images. In situ peptide fragmentation provided identification of high abundance proteins such as Actin and Collagen. Furthermore, downstream application of three different HPLCâMS strategies allowed identification of a maximum of 106 proteins, 67 of which were mass correlated to ions from IMS analysis of archived FFPE ovarian tissue. The CAAR method presented here complements previously described antigen-retrieval protocols and is an important step in being able to fully analyze the proteome of archived FFPE tissue. },

  Abstract                 = {Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a novel technology which measures the spatial distribution of drugs, lipids, peptides and proteins across tissue sections by application of mass spectrometry (MS) directly to the section surface. Several hundred analytes can be measured across a tissue in a single IMS experiment, without the need for antibodies and without prior knowledge of tissue composition or structure. In the context of human cancers, the molecular information collected by IMS approaches has been used to grade cancers and predict patient survival. IMS is thus a potentially technology capable of providing valuable complementary information to classical histology and immuno-histochemistry. Ovarian cancers have the highest mortality of any gynaecological cancer. The high mortality results from late diagnosis due to the asymptomatic nature of ovarian malignancies. Advanced stage ovarian tumours will shed cancer cells into the abdominal cavity, where they subsequently implant into the peritoneum and form metastatic tumour nodules. Despite invasive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, there is a large increase in patient morbidity following peritoneal metastasis. Compounding this issue further is the absence of reliable grading systems for ovarian cancer and a subsequent lack of individualized treatments for specific cancer sub-types. As a result of the potential ability to grade tumours and provide patient prognoses based on IMS data, the molecular composition of ovarian metastatic tumours was investigated by IMS. The novelty of IMS required set up of a robust and reproducible workflow. Methods were thus optimized for IMS analysis of both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ovarian tumour tissue. Subsequently it was shown that optimization of available antigen retrieval and tryptic digest methods for accessing FFPE tissues could achieve higher tryptic peptide signal to noise at a better spatial resolution than methods available in the literature. As such, a complete tryptic peptide IMS workflow was developed alongside liquid chromatography (LC) and MS/MS based peptide identification. In conjunction with this workflow, methods for improving the matching of IMS peptides to LC-MS/MS identified peptides using internal calibrants and development of an in-house software tool were described. As a result of the work presented in this thesis, a complete tryptic peptide IMS workflow which could be applied to virtually any cancer tissue was developed. The application of this workflow, and exploratory k-means clustering, to ovarian peritoneal metastases showed that key tryptic peptides could be found which distinguish cancer tissue from the surrounding peritoneal stroma. This represented the first step in characterizing these metastatic tumours at the molecular level. The results in this thesis are a precursor to future work which will validate these peptide markers and develop a classification system for metastatic ovarian cancers based on patient survival and response to chemotherapy.},

These FFPE tissues are, however, refractory to proteomic investigations utilizing many state of the art methodologies largely due to the high level of covalently cross-linked proteins arising from formalin fixation. A novel tissue microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Hundreds of proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, including several known PCa markers such as prostate-specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1. Quantitative proteomic profiling utilizing stable isotope labeling confirmed similar expression levels of prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase in BPH and PCa cells, whereas the expression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 was found to be greater in PCa as compared with BPH cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Glycomics and glycoproteomics have become indispensible tools in the study of glycoconjugates. Mass spectrometry based methods are standardly used to study the proteome and/or glycome and these approaches are capable of providing both, qualitative and quantitative information using top down techniques. The human immune system marks a particular area of interest for glycomics and glycoproteomics research since a large number of key proteins in innate and adaptive immunity are glycoproteins. In numerous examples, the crucial influence of glycosylation on critical steps such as receptor interaction and binding has been demonstrated. In this review, we focus on different glycomics and glycoproteomics approaches and their application for studying protein glycosylation in the immune system. },

  Abstract                 = {The early detection of a distinct disease is crucial for a successful treatment and depends on a sensitive as well as specific diagnosis. In last years tremendous attempts were undertaken to identify new biomarker applying proteomics, but no relevant candidate has been identified for clinical application. Although proteomics is enabling quantitative and qualitative analysis of proteins within complex mixtures it could not significantly contribute to this field. Therefore, different proteomics approaches have been established focusing on the direct analysis of cell populations involved in pathogenic processes to identify candidate biomarkers even for in vitro diagnosis. Here, we will outline approaches applying cell- and tissue based proteome analysis as the first decisive step in the pipeline for the discovery of new diagnostic biomarkers. We will show examples for analysing precursor lesions of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), nephron glomeruli and fibrotic and non-fibrotic liver tissue. This article provides also an overview about currently available techniques in the field of cell enrichment and quantitative proteome analysis of lowest amounts of sample.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a robust platform for the profiling of certain classes of small molecules in biological samples. When multiple samples are profiled, including replicates of the same sample and/or different sample states, one needs to account for retention time drifts between experiments. This can be achieved either by the alignment of chromatographic profiles prior to peak detection, or by matching signal peaks after they have been extracted from chromatogram data matrices. Automated retention time correction is particularly important in non-targeted profiling studies.RESULTS:A new approach for matching signal peaks based on dynamic programming is presented. The proposed approach relies on both peak retention times and mass spectra. The alignment of more than two peak lists involves three steps: (1) all possible pairs of peak lists are aligned, and similarity of each pair of peak lists is estimated; (2) the guide tree is built based on the similarity between the peak lists; (3) peak lists are progressively aligned starting with the two most similar peak lists, following the guide tree until all peak lists are exhausted. When two or more experiments are performed on different sample states and each consisting of multiple replicates, peak lists within each set of replicate experiments are aligned first (within-state alignment), and subsequently the resulting alignments are aligned themselves (between-state alignment). When more than two sets of replicate experiments are present, the between-state alignment also employs the guide tree. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on GC-MS metabolic profiling experiments acquired on wild-type and mutant Leishmania mexicana parasites.CONCLUSION:We propose a progressive method to match signal peaks across multiple GC-MS experiments based on dynamic programming. A sensitive peak similarity function is proposed to balance peak retention time and peak mass spectra similarities. This approach can produce the optimal alignment between an arbitrary number of peak lists, and models explicitly within-state and between-state peak alignment. The accuracy of the proposed method was close to the accuracy of manually-curated peak matching, which required tens of man-hours for the analyzed data sets. The proposed approach may offer significant advantages for processing of high-throughput metabolomics data, especially when large numbers of experimental replicates and multiple sample states are analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Novel methods, both molecular and statistical, are urgently needed to take advantage of recent advances in biotechnology and the human genome project for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Mass spectrometry (MS) holds great promise for biomarker identification and genome-wide protein profiling. It has been demonstrated in the literature that biomarkers can be identified to distinguish normal individuals from cancer patients using MS data. Such progress is especially exciting for the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer patients. Although various statistical methods have been utilized to identify biomarkers from MS data, there has been no systematic comparison among these approaches in their relative ability to analyze MS data.Results: We compare the performance of several classes of statistical methods for the classification of cancer based on MS spectra. These methods include: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor classifier, bagging and boosting classification trees, support vector machine, and random forest (RF). The methods are applied to ovarian cancer and control serum samples from the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program clinic at Northwestern University Hospital. We found that RF outperforms other methods in the analysis of MS data.Supplementary information: http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/proteomics/BioSupp1.html},
