% % First Draft 
% Proteomic imaging mass spectrometry is an emerging 
% field, and produces data with a uniquely complicated 
% structure that warrants the development of new 
% approaches to data analysis. We suggest a framework 
% within which existing methods can be used to analyse 
% such data. We also suggest some new approaches to the 
% analysis of such data, including an approach to feature 
% selection we call the `\gls{dipps} approachâ€™ and a 
% \gls{cca} based approach to dimension reduction prior 
% to classification.

Proteomic imaging mass spectrometry is an emerging 
field, and produces large amounts of high-dimensional 
data. 
We propose approaches to extracting useful 
information from these data --- two of particular note.
The \gls{dipps} applies to binary data and leads to 
easily interpretable maps useful for exploratory 
analyses and automated generation of feature lists that
can be used to standardise comparisons between 
datasets.
The second approach, based on \gls{cca}, reduces the 
high-dimensional data to features strongly related to 
classes and leads to good classification.  
Applications to cancer data show the success of these 
approaches.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First, my thanks go to my primary supervisor,
Associate Professor Inge Koch. 
Inge has consistently challenged me when I needed to be 
challenged, and been helpful when I needed help.
As well as offering valuable expertise, she has also 
provided guidance and without her occasional 
course-correcting nudges I certainly would have 
meandered.
In particular, I must commend Inge for her patience 
during my painfully slow progress towards becoming a 
better writer and for her immense efforts proof reading 
my thesis for mathematics, overall structure, and more.
Her consistency over the years it took me to complete 
this work has been incredible.
Even when she moved interstate I barely noticed the 
difference in her availability --- if ever I needed to 
discuss something, she would always have time for me, 
and for that I am greatly appreciative.
I could not have asked for a better supervisor.

My thanks also extend to my co-supervisor Professor 
Peter Hoffmann.
In each case when I needed something from Peter 
--- whether it be an opinion, a signature, or anything 
else --- he was always right there to support me and 
provide whatever I needed.
Peter introduced me into the proteomics community, 
a field that I had no previous experience in.
His experience and comprehensive knowledge of the 
significant contributors to the field have been 
invaluable resources.
Also, this project has been a collaborative effort with 
Peter's group, the \gls{apc}, and would never have been 
possible without their combined help. 
So I would like to extend my thanks to everyone from 
the \gls{apc}. 

For the first couple of years I worked closely with 
Dr. Johan Gustafsson and Dr. Stephan Meding, whose 
insightful explanations and very high standards of 
technical expertise were impressive, and 
extremely helpful during the course of this work.
Johan and Stephan, with the help of James Eddes,
helped introduce me to some of the foundational 
ideas in the field, and this solid foundation allowed 
me to build the rest of this work upon it.
In the later years of this work, Dr. Florian Weiland
and Dr. Dan Kortschak both helped to keep my waning 
motivation high by sharing an interest in some of the 
more technical aspects of my work.
Dan helped, and continues to help, introduce me to 
software engineering, and was a friend during some of 
the hardest periods of my thesis.
I extend my sincere appreciation to each of these 
people, for all the reasons mentioned above, and more.

For proof reading and correcting this thesis from the 
biology and mass spectrometry perspectives my thanks 
also go once again to Peter and Johan. 
Johan's comments in particular were very thorough, 
insightful, and helpful in improving this thesis.
Additionally, for proof reading this thesis for 
grammar, Melanie F\"{o}ll, Mark Witham, Imants Cielens, 
Gordon Wellman and
Peter Cassidy % and Allan Binney 
should be commended on 
their efforts and each have my deep gratitude.

During this work I also rediscovered my love of the 
outdoors --- both hiking and rock climbing --- and this 
helped me maintain a life outside of university.
For their contributions to this discovery and their 
and shared enthusiasm for it, I would like to thank 
Alex Mackay, Joshua Trestrail, Elisa Chaplin, Peter 
Arcidiaco, Jason Morton, Garth Wimbush, and the rest of 
the beautiful Adelaide rock climbing community.
Many more friends deserve my thanks, but I want to 
thank Stephen Wade and Alison Langsford specifically, 
both of whom have been particularly good friends during 
the past few years.
Stephen provided a voice of reason, 
a sympathetic ear, and has remained a good friend long 
after leaving the university. 
Along with Josephine Varney, Wei Xian Lim, 
Paul Tune, and others, he also made the post-graduate 
room a more enjoyable space to spend time within.
For many years, Alison has been a close friend and 
a person I could always confide in, bounce thoughts 
against, and I feel I leaned on her far more than 
could be expected of any ordinary friend. % these past years
For these things and more, you each have my deep 
appreciation.


Finally, the one constant in my life --- my family:
My parents, Saul and Tamar; my brother, Orr, and his 
more recent additions to our family Aviv and Tevelle. 
You have all provided me with a source of calm and a 
sense of home, and for that there are no words. 
% Finally, my grandparents, Moshe and Ahuva Sherman, you 
% have both inspired me my whole life, thank you.

% To conclude, I thought it would be nice to write 
% something in Hebrew, so I'll thank my grandparents, who 
% I have always seen as truly inspirational:

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

It should be emphasised that although this project is 
primarily based in the discipline of statistics, or 
perhaps more accurately bioinformatics, a large 
component of the work is cross-disciplinary with 
proteomics, and as such I aspire to represent 
both aspects to some degree.
Proteomics is a rapidly growing area which deals with 
the identification and characterisation of proteins, 
most commonly by a so-called `bottom-up' approach that
uses peptides resulting from proteolytic cleavage of 
the proteins with an enzyme. 
There are also `top-down' proteomics approaches that 
use intact proteins, but I will exclusively consider 
bottom-up approaches.
Many different proteomics methods include \gls{ms} 
based identification steps.
\refchap{intro} includes a brief introduction to some 
of these methods.
The focus of this thesis is on one particular, 
relatively new, application of \gls{ms} called 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.
In contrast to many other more established methods in 
proteomics, \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} has 
not yet attracted as much attention in the statistics/ 
bioinformatics literature, although some approaches to 
the analysis of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data have
been covered in proteomics/ mass spectrometry journals 
--- see \cite{Norris2007,Jones2012,Gessel2014,Stone2012,
Alexandrov2010,Alexandrov2011,Alexandrov2013} 
and references therein.
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} can produce large datasets with 
complicated structure and as such requires the 
development of novel statistical tools in order to 
analyse and interpret.
The goal of this work is to develop methods that can 
help in the analysis and interpretation of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data.

There are two strengths of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} that 
we will focus on, and these two foci split the work in 
this thesis into two parts:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} can preserve spatial 
  information in the data that would otherwise be lost.
  Taking advantage of this spatial information is the 
  focus of Chapters~\ref{chap:dipps} and
  \ref{chap:dippsApplications}, where we introduce 
  clustering as an approach to separate spatially 
  distinct regions in an automated fashion.
  We then also suggest the \gls{dipps} which we use in 
  a feature extraction approach to characterising the 
  regions separated by clustering.
  This \gls{dipps}-feature extraction provides a quick
  and easy way to identify potentially interesting 
  targets for follow-up experiments.
  Such an automated approach to identifying targets
  is useful as the standard approach is to manually 
  consider each feature and this can be time consuming 
  and even biased, particularly when considering 
  multiple large \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} datasets.
  
  \item Data can be collected from large cohorts of 
  patients through the use of \glspl{tma} combined with  
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}.
  Having access to data from many patients allows for 
  classification problems of diagnostic relevance to 
  be addressed.
  Taking advantage of the ability to collect data from 
  large patient cohorts is the focus of 
  Chapters~\ref{chap:classificationMethods} and 
  \ref{chap:classificationApplication}, where we 
  consider different approaches to the classification 
  of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data from \glspl{tma}.
  One of the more promising approaches we discuss is
  that of \gls{cca}-based variable selection, which 
  not only seems to perform well in the classification
  context, but as a by-product also identifies key
  peptides which can be further investigated in 
  follow-up biomarker validation studies.
  
\end{itemize}
In each of these two parts, we first introduce and 
discuss methods (in 
Chapters~\ref{chap:dipps} and 
\ref{chap:classificationMethods} respectively), and 
then demonstrate
the use of these methods on real data in more detail 
and discuss the biological relevance of the results 
(in Chapters~\ref{chap:dippsApplications} and
\ref{chap:classificationApplication} respectively).

The research carried out for this thesis has been 
published in four papers.
Two papers, \citet{Winderbaum2015} and 
\citet{Winderbaum2016}, are method-focused 
publications and correspond to the two foci above.
The discussion in Chapters~\ref{chap:dipps} and 
\ref{chap:dippsApplications} overlap with the ideas 
of \citet{Winderbaum2015} and explores these ideas in 
more detail.
Similarly, the main conclusions of the discussion in
Chapters~\ref{chap:classificationMethods} and 
\ref{chap:classificationApplication} are summarised in 
\citet{Winderbaum2016}.
The other two papers, \citet{Gustafsson2015} and 
\citet{Mittal2016}, are application-focused and 
correspond to the glycan and endometrial cancer 
applications introduced in 
Sections~\ref{sec:endometrialDatasets} and 
\ref{sec:NglycansDatasets} respectively.
Application-specific results are presented in 
\refsec{Nglycans} and 
\refchap{classificationApplication}, overlapping with 
results discussed in each of these two 
application-focused papers.
I have also presented the work, now published as 
\citet{Winderbaum2015} at several conferences, 
specifically giving a talk at the Statistical Society 
of Australia Inc. Young Statisticians Conference in 
$2013$, a talk as an invited speaker to the Statistical 
Society of Australia Inc. Australian Statistical 
Conference in $2014$, and presenting a poster at the 
Australasian Proteomics Society Annual Lorne 
Proteomics Symposium in $2015$.


We have access to several high quality applications of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data through our collaborative 
work with the \gls{apc}\footnote{{\tt http://www.adelaide.edu.au/mbs/proteomics/} \\ Level 1, Molecular Life Sciences \\ The University of Adelaide \\ SA 5005 Australia}.
Our collaboration with the \gls{apc} on several of 
these applications has also produced a number of 
tangential publications of which I am not the main 
author --- including \citet{Gustafsson2015} and 
\citet{Mittal2016}.
In total we consider three such applications of 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ovarian Cancer --- We consider approaches to the
  exploratory analyses of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data in 
  depth, and make extensive use of the ovarian cancer 
  data of \citet{Gustafsson2012thesis} to illustrate 
  these methods.
  In \refchap{dipps} we demonstrate the separation of 
  cancerous tumour tissue from its surrounding 
  non-tumour tissues by using an automated clustering 
  approach. 
  We then suggest a \gls{dipps}-feature selection 
  scheme for selecting a short-list of peptides that 
  are more highly expressed in tumour tissue than 
  non-tumour tissue. 
  We published this \gls{dipps}-feature selection 
  approach as \citet{Winderbaum2015}.
  In \refsec{datasetComparisons} we consider the 
  results of applying this combined feature extraction 
  approach to many sections from the same and different 
  patients, and comparing the results to explore within
  and between patient variability in 
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data.
  
  \item Murine Glycans --- It would be of interest to 
  detect glycans with \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims}, rather 
  than just peptides and proteins.
  In \refsec{dataDependant} we demonstrate that the 
  \gls{dipps}-based feature extraction step developed 
  with the ovarian cancer data in mind can also be used 
  to quickly and easily produce a short-list of 
  potential glycans for validation in the 
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data. 
  This experiment successfully demonstrated that 
  glycans can in fact be detected using 
  \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} \citep{Gustafsson2015}, and 
  this opens up new applications in cancer research.

  \item Endometrial Cancer --- Taking advantage of the
  second strength of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} noted above,
  \citet{Mittal2016} collected data from the primary 
  tumours of a cohort of endometrial cancer patients 
  using two \glspl{tma}.
  If it is possible to predict these patients' \gls{lnm}
  status from these primary tumour data, this would 
  give the surgeon a diagnostic tool to decide
  if the lymph nodes need to be removed. 
  Removing the lymph nodes is associated with serious 
  complications for the patient, and \gls{lnm} is 
  highly relevant to survival and treatment, so this 
  decision is important for producing positive patient 
  outcomes. 
  
  We introduce some classification and variable 
  reduction methods, as well as our novel approach to 
  pre-processing and normalisation of these data in 
  \refchap{classificationMethods}.
  In \refchap{classificationApplication} we consider 
  the results of applying these methods to the 
  endometrial cancer \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} data, 
  concluding that \gls{lnm} can be predicted from these
  data to a significant degree, and therefore 
  warranting further studies applying this method as a 
  diagnostic tool for \gls{lnm} status in the clinic. 
  We published these results and our approach to this 
  classification problem as \citet{Winderbaum2016}.
\end{itemize}
Each of these applications of \gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} are
introduced in more detail in \refsec{data}.
Note that throughout this thesis we introduce many 
established ideas from a number of fields, including 
proteomics, mass spectrometry, and statistics.
Where possible we include specific references to these
ideas, but some of the ideas we discuss are commonly 
known in a particular field. 
For any such background knowledge without a specific 
reference included, please see \citet{Lovric2011} for 
proteomics and mass spectrometry background, 
\citet{Koch2013} for multivariate statistics, or 
\citet{Casella2002} for statistics more generally.

It should also be noted that a significant 
proportion of the work that went into this project 
involved writing software tools to handle large 
\gls{maldi}-\gls{ims} datasets.
Although not explicitly discussed in this thesis, all
associated code is available from
